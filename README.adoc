yaml2po and po2yaml
===================

These are two simple Perl scripts that convert between YAML files containing a
hash of source strings to translated strings and gettext PO files.  Both scripts
read from the files on the command line (or standard input) and write to
standard output.

Note that the generated PO files are very minimal, since the YAML input is only
expected to contain a single hash.
